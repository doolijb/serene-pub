Welcome to Serene Pub for Windows!

Thank you for downloading Serene Pub.

To run the app:

1. Extract the archive to your preferred location.
2. Open the extracted folder (e.g., serene-pub-<version>-win).
3. Double-click the "run.cmd" file to start Serene Pub.

   - The first launch will automatically download and set up Node.js if needed. No manual installation is required.

4. On your Windows PC, access Serene Pub from http://0.0.0.0:3000 or http://localhost:3000.

Notes:
- Serene Pub will attempt to automatically identify your local network IP address, allowing access across other devices (e.g. mobile phones.)
    - To find your local IP, open Command Prompt and run: ipconfig
    - Look for the "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter (e.g., 192.168.1.42). You can access Serene Pub from your phone at http://<your-ip>:3000

Troubleshooting:
- If double-clicking "run.cmd" does not start the app, try right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator."
- If you see a security warning, click "More info" and then "Run anyway."
- If Node.js fails to download, check your internet connection or firewall settings.

Uninstall:
- To remove Serene Pub, simply delete the extracted folder. No files are installed outside this directory.
