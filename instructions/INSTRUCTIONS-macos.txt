Welcome to Serene Pub for macOS!

Thank you for downloading Serene Pub.

To run the app:

1. Extract the archive to your preferred location.
2. Choose one of the following ways to start the app:

   a) Graphical (no terminal required):
      - In Finder, right-click the "Serene Pub" file.
      - Select "Get Info" and check "Executable" under permissions if available (or use Terminal to run: chmod +x "Serene Pub").
      - Double-click the "Serene Pub" icon to launch. This will open a terminal and start the app.

   b) Terminal method:
      - Open the Terminal app.
      - Navigate to the extracted folder (e.g., serene-pub-<version>-macos):

            cd /path/to/serene-pub-<version>-macos

      - Run the app with:

            bash run.sh

      - If you get a permission error, run: chmod +x run.sh

3. On first launch, the app will automatically download and set up a local Node.js runtime if needed. No manual installation is required.

4. On your Mac, access Serene Pub from http://0.0.0.0:3000 or http://localhost:3000.

Notes:
- Serene Pub will attempt to automatically identify your local network IP address, allowing access across other devices (e.g. mobile phones.)
    - To find your local IP, run: hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
    - For example, if the result is 192.168.1.42, you can access Serene Pub from your phone at http://192.168.1.42:3000

Troubleshooting:
- If double-clicking "Serene Pub" does not open a terminal, try the terminal method above.
- If you see a message about missing permissions, run: chmod +x "Serene Pub" run.sh
- If your system does not have curl or a supported terminal, install curl (brew install curl) or use the terminal method above.
